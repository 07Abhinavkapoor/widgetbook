To use Widgetbook Cloud, make sure to go to [app.widgetbook.io](https://app.widgetbook.io/#/welcome).

If you are new to Widgetbook Cloud make sure to create a new account first. 
For this, use the Signup option and provide the necessary information. 
You'll be logged in, once the signup is completed.

If you already have an account, use your login information to sign in again. 

You can also reset your password by using password recovery.

## Billing account

To create a project, a billing account is required. 
Since only billing account owners can create projects, the billing account should be created by the project owner or team lead. 

If you want to create a billing account, see [Billing](/widgetbook-cloud/billing) for more information.

## Create a project

As described above, projects can only be created by a billing account owner.
If you are not an owner, the user interface will show you a message, to create a billing account first.

To create a project, go to [app.widgetbook.io/#/create-project](https://app.widgetbook.io/#/create-project) and follow the steps.
