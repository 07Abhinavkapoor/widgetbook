## Billing account

To create a project, a billing account is required.

## Create a project

As described above, projects can only be created by a billing account owner.
If you are not an owner, the user interface will show you a message, to create a billing account first.

To create a project, chose _Projects_ in the menu, click on _Add project_ and follow the steps.
