# Accessing resources

It is natural, that you application makes requests to your APIs or fetch images, which are displayed in your app.
Unfortunately, your browser is likely to block these requests based on the [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

This guide helps you to get these problems resolved.
We host all the Widgetbooks under the domain `hosting.widgetbook.io`.
To make requests from your app, your service has to allow our domain.

## Google Storage

The Google Storage docs [Configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/configuring-cors) describe in detail how to set this up. But you can also use the steps below.

Make sure that you are not overriding any previous settings by looking up what's already configured for your bucket: `gsutil cors get gs://BUCKET_NAME`. 
If you just created the bucket, the command will return an empty result.

A new configuration can be set with `gsutil cors set CORS_CONFIG_FILE gs://BUCKET_NAME`.

The config `cors-config.json` file might look like this:

```
[
    {
      "origin": ["https://hosting.widgetbook.io"],
      "method": ["GET", "HEAD"],
      "responseHeader": ["Content-Type"],
      "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
    }
]
```

Use `gsutil cors set cors-config.json gs://BUCKET_NAME` to apply the new configuration.
It might take some time until the new configuration is active.
If you want to try the new configuration, make sure to empty the browser cache.
