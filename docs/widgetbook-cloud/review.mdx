# Review (beta)

> **NOTE:** Since the Review feature is currently in beta, we're not aiming to migrate any data created previous to the official (non-beta) release to make changes to the feature easier for our development team.

The Widgetbook Cloud _Review_ feature (currently in beta) allows teams to review added, changed or removed components.
The Review feature closely relates to reviews known from Pull-Requests. 
For each Pull-Request, our new CLI v2 analyzes the changes to your Widgetbook and creates a review.
Members of a frontend-team now can review each _changed_ use-case in isolation and add comments for other team members.

Once all changes from the review are accepted, a developer closes the Pull-Request and the review's status gets updated to `merged`.
For this to work, a webhook to our services is required.

## Requirements

To use Widgetbook Cloud _Review_ your setup has to meet the following requirements:
- Use `widgetbook_generator` package in version `v2.4.0-beta.1` (no special configuration required).
- Use `widgetbook` package in version `v2.4.0-beta.1` (no special configuration required).
- Use Widgetbook CLI `v2-beta`
- Setup a GitHub webhook

## CLI v2-beta

Since there are plenty of Git provider available, it can be hard to maintain them all.
Since the Widgetbook Uploader is implemented in Dart, we wrapped the implementation with a Dart CLI to make it easily accessible.

A pre-compiled version of the CLI is available for the most common systems:

| OS      | Architecture | Link |
| ------- | ------------ | ---- |
| Mac OS  | x86          | [ðŸ”—](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/widgetbook-cloud.appspot.com/o/tools%2Fcli-v2-beta-production-macos-x86.exe?alt=media) |
| Mac OS  | ARM          | coming soon, use x86 version with Rosetta for now |
| Windows | x86          | [ðŸ”—](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/widgetbook-cloud.appspot.com/o/tools%2Fcli-v2-beta-production-windows-x86.exe?alt=media) |
| Ubuntu  | x86          | [ðŸ”—](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/widgetbook-cloud.appspot.com/o/tools%2Fcli-v2-beta-production-ubuntu-x86.exe?alt=media) |

But it's understandable if you'd like to check the source code first and/or compile it yourself. 
See the [widgetbook-hosting](https://github.com/widgetbook/widgetbook-hosting) repository for more information.

### Arguments

The CLI accepts the following arguments.
> Note that the useage of the `path` argument received breaking changes!

### CLI Example (GitHub)

The CLI extracts information from `widgetbook_generator` and also obtains branch information from git.
For this to work properly make sure to checkout your code with `fetch-depth: '0'`. 
Also make sure to run the `build_runner` before calling the `CLI`.

```yaml
name: Build 
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: '0'

      - name: Show branches
        run: git branch -a

      - name: Setup flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v1
        with:
          channel: stable

      - name: Get dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      - name: Run build runner
        run: flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

      - name: Build Website
        run: flutter build web -t lib/main.widgetbook.dart

      - name: Upload Widgetbook
        run: |
          curl -o ./cli.exe 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/widgetbook-cloud.appspot.com/o/tools%2Fcli-v2-beta-production-ubuntu-x86.exe?alt=media'
          chmod +x cli.exe 
          ./cli.exe \
                --path "./" --api-key <API-KEY> \
                --branch \
                $GITHUB_HEAD_REF \
                --repository \
                $GITHUB_REPOSITORY \
                --commit \
                $GITHUB_SHA \
                --actor \
                $GITHUB_ACTOR \
                --base-branch \
                $GITHUB_BASE_REF \
                --base-commit \
                ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }} \
                --git-provider \
                "GitHub"
```

## Setup Webhook (GitHub)

A GitHub Webhook allows Widgetbook Cloud to receive information about changes within your repository.
Widgetbook Cloud can automatically set the state of a Review to `closed` or `merged` when a corresponding Pull-Request is `closed` or `merged`.
For this to work, you need to configure a webhook. 
See [Setting up a webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/creating-webhooks#setting-up-a-webhook) for instructions on how to do this.

### Requirements

You need to meet the following requirements to setup a webhook to Widgetbook Cloud:
- Webhook Secret
- Payload URL

### Obtaining the Webhook Secret

The webhook secret can be obtained by going to the project overview and click the `Get secret` button within the webhook card.

### Setting up the webhook

1. Go to [https://github.com/username/repo-name/settings/hooks](https://github.com/username/repo-name/settings/hooks). Make sure to replace `username` and `repo-name` with your appropriate values.
1. Click `Add webhook`
1. Paste `https://api.widgetbook.io/v1/webhooks/github` into the `Payload URL` field.
1. Set `Content type` to `application/json`
1. Paste your Widgetbook Cloud webhook secret into the `Secret` field.
1. Select when to trigger the webhook.
    1. Select `Send me everything` or
    2. Select `Let me select individual events` and enable `Pull requests`. You can disable all other options.
