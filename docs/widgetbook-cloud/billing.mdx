# Billing

Within Widgetbook Cloud, a billing account is required to create projects.
Projects will are disabled if no subscription is available or if a subscription is canceled or postponed.

## Create a billing account

To create a billing account, make sure to select _Billing_ from the navigation rail on the left.
If your account is not associated with a billing account, the user interface will indicate this. 
Otherwise, the user interface will show you the current billing account. 

Make sure to follow the instructions for creating the billing account provided by the user interface.

## Subscribing to a plan

After a billing account is created, the user interface will show an option to subscribe to a Widgetbook Cloud plan. 
Plans allow customers to create and activate projects as well as invite collaborators to their projects. 

Make sure to follow the instructions of the user interface. 
After a plan is selected, the Widgetbook Cloud application will forward you to Stripe for payment.
Once the payment via Stripe is completed the subscribed plan will show in the user interface of Widgetbook Cloud. 
This happens within seconds.

## Managing a plan's subscription

Once a subscription to a plan is active, the user interface shows the active plan.
In addition, the Widgetbook Cloud application provides a button to view and manage the details of the plan.
If the button is pressed, the application forwards to the Stripe customer protal which allows to view recent payments and manage the subscription.

## Invoicing

Currently all Widgetbook Cloud subscription plans are user based. 
With each plan, a billing account is invoiced for the number of _unique_ users.
A _unique_ user is determined based on the user's email address.
Therefore, a user _John_ with email address _john@examplebook.io_ is invoiced once even if John is a member of multiple projects (given that all the projects use the same billing account).

**Example 1** 

Lets assume the following project structure with it's members:

- Project A
    - John (john@examplebook.io)
    - Mia (mia@examplebook.io)

The billing account will be invoiced for 2 unique users across a single project. 

**Example 2** 

Lets assume the following project structure with it's members:

- Project A
    - John (john@examplebook.io)
    - Mia (mia@examplebook.io)
- Project B
    - John (john@examplebook.io)
    - Mia (mia@examplebook.io)

The billing account will be invoiced for 2 unique users across 2 projects. 

**Example 3** 

Lets assume the following project structure with it's members:

- Project A
    - John (john@examplebook.io)
    - Mia (mia@examplebook.io)
- Project B
    - John (john@examplebook.io)
    - Mia (mia@examplebook.io)
- Project C
    - John (john@examplebook.io)
    - Ava (ava@examplebook.io)

The billing account will be invoiced for 3 unique users across 3 projects.
