# Widgetbook Hosting

The Widgetbook Hosting allows users to upload the Flutter web version of a Widgetbook to Widgetbook Cloud.
To upload any widgetbook, you require an API key.

## How to create an API key

To create an API key, you need to login with your account at [app.widgetbook.io](https://app.widgetbook.io). 
API keys are bound to projects. 
Therefore, you require a project to retrieve an API key. 
Furthermore, only users with the `Owner` role can fetch the API key of a project. 

As a user you can create a new project by clicking the add button. 

On the detail page of a project, a card which allows to fetch the API key is displayed. 

Click the button on the card to fetch the API key. 
The key will be copied to your clipboard.
