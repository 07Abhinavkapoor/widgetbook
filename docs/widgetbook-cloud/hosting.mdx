# Widgetbook Hosting

The Widgetbook Hosting allows users to upload the Flutter web version of a Widgetbook to Widgetbook Cloud.
To upload any widgetbook, you require an API key.

## How to create an API key

To create an API key, you need to login with your account at [app.widgetbook.io](https://app.widgetbook.io). 
API keys are bound to projects. 
Therefore, you require a project to retrieve an API key. 
Furthermore, only users with the `Owner` role can fetch the API key of a project. 

If you are just starting out, make sure to create a new project. 
To create a project, make sure to also [create a billing account](/widgetbook-cloud/billing).

On the detail page of a project, a card which allows to fetch the API key is displayed. 
Click the button on the card to fetch the API key. 
The key will be copied to your clipboard.

## GitHub

```yaml
name: Build 
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v1
        with:
          channel: stable

      - name: Build Website
        run: flutter build web -t path/to/main.widgetbook.dart

      - name: Upload Widgetbook
        uses: widgetbook/widgetbook-hosting@0.0.24
        with:
          path: 'build/web'
          api_key: '<your API key>'
```

By running this script, a folder structure `./build/web/` with the widgetbook web app will be created. The output folder of the build is required by the Widgetbook Hosting action and will be uploaded to the collaboration platform.

### Inputs

The GitHub action defines the following inputs: 

| Input | Default | Is required |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `path` | `build/web` |  |
| `api_key` | ➖ | ✅ |

## GitLab

The docker image is provided at Docker Hub and is named widgetbook-hosting-gitlab. You can access the executable by calling /widgetbook-hosting.

By running this script, a folder structure ./build/web/ with the widgetbook web app will be created. 
The output folder of the build is required by the Widgetbook Hosting action and will be uploaded to the collaboration platform. 
Since the hosting stage requires the build output, it'll be exposed by the stage via an artifact.

```yaml
stages:
  - compile
  - host

compile:
  stage: compile
  image: "cirrusci/flutter:2.8.1"

  before_script:
    - export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
  script:
    - flutter build web -t lib/main.widgetbook.dart
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - build/web/

host: 
  stage: host
  variables:
    WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY: "<api key>"
    WIDGETBOOK_BUILD_PATH: "build/web"
  image: 
    name: widgetbook/widgetbook-hosting-gitlab:dev
  script:
    - /widgetbook-hosting
```

### Environment variables

The docker image reads git specific information like branch name, repository name, etc from the environment variables but also requires two mandatory environment variables provided by the user:

| Environment variable | Description | Is required |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `WIDGETBOOK_BUILD_PATH` | The path to the web build of the widgetbook. For small repositories this is likely `build/web/` | ✅ |
| `WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY` | The API key for your company. See [How to create an API key](/widgetbook-cloud/hosting#how-to-create-an-api-key)| ✅ |

## BitBucket
The Widgetbook Hosting docker image allows Widgetbook Cloud user to upload the widgetbook version which has been uploaded to BitBucket.

The docker image is provided at Docker Hub and is named widgetbook-hosting-bitbucket. 
You can access the executable by calling /widgetbook-hosting.

``` yaml
pipelines:
  branches:
    dev:
      - step:
          name: Build web
          image: 
            name: cirrusci/flutter
          script:
            - flutter build web -t lib/main.widgetbook.dart
          artifacts:
            - build/**
      - step:
          name: Host on widgetbook
          image: 
            name: widgetbook/widgetbook-hosting-bitbucket:dev
          script:
            - /widgetbook-hosting
```

### Environment variables

The docker image reads git specific information like branch name, repository name, etc from the environment variables but also requires two mandatory environment variables provided by the user:
In BitBucket you can add _repository variables_ by going to the repository settings and then selecting _repository variables_.

| Environment variable | Description | Is required |
| ----- | ------- | ----------- |
| `WIDGETBOOK_BUILD_PATH` | The path to the web build of the widgetbook. For small repositories this is likely `build/web/` | ✅ |
| `WIDGETBOOK_API_KEY` | The API key for your company. See [How to create an API key](/widgetbook-cloud/hosting#how-to-create-an-api-key)| ✅ |
