# Widgetbook Hosting

The Widgetbook Hosting allows users to upload the Flutter web version of a Widgetbook to Widgetbook Cloud.
To upload any Widgetbook, you require an API key.

## How to create an API key

To create an API key, you need to login with your account on Widgetbook Cloud.
API keys are bound to projects. 
Therefore, you require a project to retrieve an API key.

<Info>Only users users with the `Owner` role can fetch the API key of a project.</Info>

If you are not the owner of your project but would still like to fetch the API key, please ask your project owner to promote you from member to owner. 
For information on member management, please see [member management](/widgetbook-cloud/projects#member-management).

On the detail page of a project, a card which allows to fetch the API key is displayed. 
Click the button on the card to fetch the API key. 

<Success>The API key will be copied to your clipboard.</Success>

## Hosting with CI/CD vendors

If youd like to upload a Widgetbook Build and create Reviews your CI/CD pipeline requires the following:
1. Install Flutter SDK
1. Run the [`build_runner`](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) package via `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
1. Build your Widgetbook via `flutter build web -t path/to/widgetbook/main/file`
1. Activate the [Widgetbook CLI](/widgetbook-cli/overview) via `dart pub global activate widgetbook_cli 3.0.0-beta.22`
1. Run the CLI [as described in the docs](/widgetbook-cli/overview)
