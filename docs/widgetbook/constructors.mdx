# Constructors

`Widgetbook` allows developers to define whatever `Theme` they have defined for their app. To accompany every theme and the ones defined by Flutter, the following constructors exist: 

Theme | Constructor | Defaults to
------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
Custom Theme | `Widgetbook<YourTheme>` | âž–
Material | `Widgetbook.material` | `Widgetbook<ThemeData>`
Cupertino | `Widgetbook.cupertino` | `Widgetbook<CupertinoThemeData>`


As you can see from the constructor definitions, `Widgetbook` allows to define your Theme type to accompany any implementation. However, most developers will likely use `Widgetbook.material` as shown [in the example](#Usage) above.
