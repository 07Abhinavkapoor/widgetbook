# Setup

The `widgetbook` package provides a flutter widget called `Widgetbook` in which custom widgets from your app can be injected.

## Setting up

First, add `widgetbook` as a dev dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
dev_dependencies:
  widgetbook:
```

Since the Widgetbook is launched as a separate app, it is recommended to create another `main` method. 
This enables you to switch between your app and `Widgetbook` at any time. 
You can even launch your app and `Widgetbook` simultaneously.

The folder structure might look like this:

```
example_app
├─ lib
│  ├─ main.dart
├─ widgetbook
│  ├─ main.dart
│  ├─ widgetbook.dart
├─ pubspec.yaml
```

The `widgetbook/widgetbook.dart` file contains the `Widgetbook` wrapped within a stateless widget that enables hot reloading. The code looks like this: 

```dart
class HotReload extends StatelessWidget {
  const HotReload({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Widgetbook.material(...);
  }
}
```

In the `widgetbook/main.dart` run the `HotReload` widget:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(HotReload());
}
```
