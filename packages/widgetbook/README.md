# Getting Started

This package provides a flutter widget called `Widgetbook` in which custom widgets from your app can be injected.

## Setting up

Since the Widgetbook is launched as a separate app, it is recommended to create another main method. This enables you to switch between your app and the `Widgetbook` at any time. You can even launch your app and `Widgetbook` simultaneously.

The folder structure might look like this:
```
example_app
+ lib
+--- main.dart
+ stories
+--- main.dart
+--- widgetbook.dart
```

The `stories/widgetbook.dart` file contains the `Widgetbook` wrapped within a stateless widget that enables hot reloading. The code looks like this: 

```dart
class HotReload extends StatelessWidget {
  const HotReload({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Widgetbook(...);
  }
}
```

In the `stories/main.dart` run the `HotReload` widget:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(HotReload());
}
```

## Run the Widgetbook

`Widgetbook` is supported on the following environments.

Environment | Status | Annotation
------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
MacOS | âœ… | 
Windows | âœ… |
Web | âœ… | No hot reload, but hot restart (see [Issue 4](https://github.com/widgetbook/widgetbook/issues/4))
Mobile | âž– | Will run, but is not optimized. If you see a usecase for `Widgetbook` on mobile let us know. 

See the [Desktop support for Flutter](https://flutter.dev/desktop) page for setup instructions.

Run the `Widgetbook` main method by executing `flutter run -t stories/main.dart`.

# Inject your widgets

Your widgets can be organized into different areas of interest by using `Category`, `Folder`, `WidgetElement` and `Story`.

```dart
class HotReload extends StatelessWidget {
  const HotReload({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Widgetbook(
      categories: [
        Category(
          name: 'widgets',
          widgets: [
            WidgetElement(
              name: '$CustomWidget',
              stories: [
                Story(
                  name: 'Default',
                  builder: (context) => CustomWidget(),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
          folders: [
            Folder(
              name: 'Texts',
              widgets: [
                WidgetElement(
                  name: 'Normal Text',
                  stories: [
                    Story(
                      name: 'Default',
                      builder: (context) => Text(
                        'The brown fox ...',
                      ),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ],
      appInfo: AppInfo(
        name: 'Widgetbook Example',
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Set storybook name

Customize `Widgetbook`'s name according to the project by using appInfo:

```dart
Widgetbook(
  appInfo: AppInfo(
    name: 'Your apps name',
  ),
)
```

## Adding Themes

Import your app's theme for a realistic preview by using `Widgetbook`'s `lightTheme` and `darkTheme` properties:
```dart
Widgetbook(
  lightTheme: lightTheme,
  darkTheme: darkTheme,
)
```

## Add devices

Customize the preview by defining preview devices: 

```dart
Widgetbook(
  devices: [
    Apple.iPhone11,
    Apple.iPhone12,
    Samsung.s10,
    Samsung.s21ultra,
  ]
)
```

Right now there is a predefinied short list of devices but let us know which you need in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/zT4AMStAJA). We will extend the list of predefinied devices in the future!

### Define own device

You can also define your own device by using the `Device` class:

```dart
Device(
  name: 'Custom Device',
  resolution: Resolution.dimensions(
    width: 500,
    height: 500,
    scaleFactor: 2,
  ),
  type: DeviceType.tablet,
),
```

# Known Issues

- Hot reloading on web is currently not working properly. This is due to the fact that hot reloading is actually a restart. The problem is tracked in [widgetbook/issues/4](https://github.com/widgetbook/widgetbook/issues/4). For now we recommended to use MacOS or Windows as a platform for development.
